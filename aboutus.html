   <p>WrestleMania is the biggest annual professional wrestling event produced by WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment)
     and is often regarded as the "Super Bowl of professional wrestling." <br>Created by WWE owner Vince McMahon, 
     the first WrestleMania took place on March 31, 1985,<br> at Madison Square Garden in New York City,
      helping to elevate WWE into mainstream entertainment with celebrity appearances like Muhammad Ali,<br>
       Cyndi Lauper, and Mr. T. Over the years, it has grown into a global phenomenon, attracting fans worldwide.
        The event features high-profile main event matches,<br> championship bouts, and legendary moments,
         such as The Undertaker’s legendary undefeated streak (21-0) before losing at WrestleMania 30.<br>
          Some of the most iconic matches include Hulk Hogan bodyslamming Andre the Giant at WrestleMania 3,
           Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker at WrestleMania 25,<br>
            and the intense rivalry between Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock across multiple WrestleManias. 
            WrestleMania also includes celebrity appearances, a Hall of Fame induction ceremony, <br>
            and has expanded to a two-night event in recent years. It is one of WWE’s biggest financial successes, <br>
            selling out stadiums worldwide and influencing pop culture through video games, documentaries, and TV specials. <br>
            WrestleMania 40 (2024), held at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, featured marquee matches like Roman Reigns vs.<br>
             Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and Seth Rollins vs. Drew McIntyre.<br> As WWE continues to evolve, 
             WrestleMania remains the pinnacle of professional wrestling, bringing together history,<br>
              entertainment, and athleticism on the grandest stage of them all.</p>
